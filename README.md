# CometCipher
Our team will design and implement a simple encryption based on existing encryption tools. This will require extensive research on current state-of-the-art encryptions, a strategic design process to maximize strengths and minimize weakness in the new encryption, and a careful analysis of how this new implementation compares to existing encryptions.
