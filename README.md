# CometCipher
Our team will design and implement a simple encryption based on existing encryption tools. This will require extensive research on current state-of-the-art encryptions, a strategic design process to maximize strengths and minimize weakness in the new encryption, and a careful analysis of how this new implementation compares to existing encryptions.

At the moment these algorithms are used mostly for understanding how each of the top algorithms work to help us create our own simpler version. This is how you run the different programs at the moment

1. AES.java must be run on its own. It will work in an IDE that can complie java. Once the user runs the program, they are prompted to give the message to encrypt. The message is then encrypted and dycrypted to the show the user that the algorithm works.
