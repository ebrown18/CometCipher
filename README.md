Our team will design and implement a simple encryption based on existing encryption tools. This will require extensive research on current state-of-the-art encryptions, a strategic design process to maximize strengths and minimize weakness in the new encryption, and a careful analysis of how this new implementation compares to existing encryptions.

At the moment these algorithms are used mostly for understanding how each of the top algorithms work to help us create our own simpler version. This is how you run the different programs at the moment

1. AES.java must be run on its own. It will work in an IDE that can complie java. Once the user runs the program, they are prompted to give the message to encrypt. The message is then encrypted and dycrypted to the show the user that the algorithm works.

2. DES.java must be run on its own and there must be a .txt file to encrypt within the same directory. It will work in an IDE that can compile java. One the user runs the program, they are prompted to enter a .txt file to encrypt. The file is then encrypted and decrpyted. Two separate files willed be created called "encrypteddata.txt" and "decrypteddata.txt". The console will print "The encrypted and decrypted files have been created successfully." to show that the program has succeeded.

3. To run RSA.java you can either run it in an IDE or the terminal. The messages to be encrypted/decrypted are hardcoded in to avoid having to deal with input from the user. To run with the terminal: navigate to the java file using cd, input the command "javac RSA.java" and then the command "java RSA"
